<domain_identification>

- Domains should be identified from verified requirements and accepted decisions when relevant.
- Domain identification must identify business capabilities.
- Domain identification must identify responsibility boundaries.
- Domain identification must identify ownership boundaries.
- Domain identification must identify cohesive functional areas.
- Domains should represent meaningful responsibility groups rather than implementation units.
- Domain identification must avoid creating implementation details.
- Domain identification must preserve traceability to the verified requirements and accepted decisions that justify each domain.

</domain_identification>

<domain_boundary_definition>

- Domain boundaries should separate responsibilities clearly.
- Domain boundaries should minimize unnecessary coupling.
- Domain boundaries should preserve cohesion.
- Domain boundaries should reduce cross-domain dependencies when practical.
- Boundary definitions should prioritize maintainability and ownership clarity.
- Boundary definitions must distinguish domain responsibility from implementation structure.
- Boundary definitions must remain traceable to verified requirements and relevant repository artifacts.
- Domain-specific policies should remain with the domain that owns the responsibility.
- Shared policies that affect multiple domains should be identified as cross-domain concerns instead of duplicated under each domain.

</domain_boundary_definition>

<domain_dependency_analysis>

- Domain dependencies must identify upstream dependencies.
- Domain dependencies must identify downstream dependencies.

<domain_grouping>

- Domain grouping should support team allocation.

- Domain grouping should support specification planning.
- Domain grouping should support downstream planning without creating implementation plans.
- Closely coupled domains may be grouped when separation would introduce unnecessary coordination cost.
- Domain grouping must preserve meaningful responsibility boundaries.
- Domain grouping must avoid grouping unrelated outcomes solely for convenience.
- Domain grouping should identify coordination needs when grouped domains still have distinct responsibilities.

## Standard Output Format

### Domain Decision
- Recommended domain ownership and boundaries.
- Explain why the responsibility belongs to the selected domain.

### Entities / Value Objects
- Main entities, value objects, and their responsibilities.
- Include only entities relevant to the requested feature or design question.

### Relationships
- Relationships with other domains or aggregates.
- Ownership, dependency direction, and coupling concerns.

### Business Rules
- Domain invariants, lifecycle rules, and state transitions.
- Include validation rules only when they are part of domain policy.
- Include policies that belong to the domain's responsibility boundary.
- Identify shared or conflicting policies as cross-domain concerns or open questions.

### Transaction Boundary
- Recommended transaction scope.
- Identify which operations should be atomic and which can be handled asynchronously.

### Risks / Open Questions
- Ambiguous ownership, missing policy decisions, or integration risks.
- List only unresolved items that affect implementation or design correctness.

## Success Criteria

- Domain boundaries are defined from verified requirements.
- Domain responsibilities are cohesive and non-overlapping.
- Key entities or capability areas are identified.
- Domain relationships and dependencies are documented.
- Ownership guidance is provided when supported by verified context.
- Coupling risks or unresolved boundary questions are identified.
- Domain decisions remain consistent with verified requirements and artifacts.

<trusted_sources>

- Verified requirements are authoritative for domain identification, boundaries, dependencies, grouping, and allocation guidance.
- Accepted decisions are authoritative for selected direction, constraints, and downstream impact when they affect domain analysis.
- Requirement artifacts are authoritative when they are current and consistent with verified requirements.
- Existing repository artifacts are authoritative when they describe current domains, responsibilities, dependencies, ownership, or constraints.
- Existing documentation is authoritative when it is current and consistent with verified requirements and repository state.
- Existing domain definitions are authoritative when they are current and consistent with verified requirements and repository artifacts.
- Repository governance resources are authoritative for ownership boundaries, artifact expectations, documentation locations, and downstream workflow expectations.
- Domain decisions must prioritize verified information over assumptions.
- Conflicting information must be reconciled before domain structures are finalized.
- Unverified information must be recorded as an assumption or unresolved question rather than treated as a domain decision.

<cli_policy>

- CLI verification may be used when repository artifacts, existing documentation, or existing domain structures affect domain analysis.
- CLI usage should support verification rather than domain discovery.
- Repository artifacts should be inspected when they affect domain boundaries, dependencies, ownership, grouping, or allocation guidance.
- Existing documentation should be inspected when it defines current domain responsibilities or constraints.
- Git history should be inspected only when artifact provenance or historical domain decisions affect domain analysis.
- CLI verification must be scoped to domain analysis and domain validation.
