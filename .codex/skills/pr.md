</pr_triggers>

<traceability_validation>

- Pull requests must preserve traceability across requirements, issues, commits, submitted changes, and related artifacts.
- Issue-to-PR traceability must identify the requested work that the pull request addresses.
- When a related issue exists, pull request creation must reference the issue in the pull request body so GitHub Development traceability can link the pull request and issue.
- Use a closing keyword such as `Closes #<issue-number>` when the pull request is expected to complete the issue; otherwise use a non-closing reference such as `Refs #<issue-number>`.
- Closing keyword decisions must follow the Pull Request Issue Links guidance in `skills/common.md`.
- Related label traceability must identify which pull request labels are derived from related issues, repository label strategy, or verified pull request scope.
- Assignee ownership traceability must identify issue ownership context, pull request author context, or verified repository ownership information when assignees are assigned.
- Commit-to-PR traceability must identify which commits contribute to the submitted work.
- Requirement traceability must identify the originating requirement, specification, task, or planning artifact when available.
- Artifact traceability must identify affected requirements, API specifications, data models, flows, sequence interactions, or architecture artifacts when relevant.
- Reviewers must be able to identify what work was requested, what work was completed, and what changes were submitted.
- Reviewers must be able to identify how related issues, labels, and assignee ownership context remain consistent when metadata is assigned.
- Traceability gaps must be identified before pull request submission.
- Traceability must be based on verified repository and GitHub information.

</traceability_validation>

<issue_closure_policy>

- Use `Closes #<issue-number>` only when the submitted pull request fully satisfies the verified issue scope and acceptance expectations.
- Use `Refs #<issue-number>` when the pull request is partial, exploratory, prerequisite, documentation-only for a broader issue, or otherwise does not complete the issue outcome.
- Use `Refs #<issue-number>` when the issue should remain open for manual validation, follow-up implementation, stakeholder acceptance, or post-merge operations outside the pull request scope.
- Broad tracking, epic, parent, or multi-part issues should not be closed by a pull request unless the pull request completes the final remaining verified work for that issue.
- When closure confidence is uncertain from available evidence, use a non-closing reference and report the uncertainty in the pull request description.

</issue_closure_policy>

<change_summary>

- Change summaries must be based on verified repository changes.
- Change summaries must explain what changed and why.
- Completed work must be summarized according to the actual submitted branch and commits.
- Repository impact must be described when changes affect structure, configuration, documentation, artifacts, or governance metadata.
- Behavioral changes must be identified when submitted changes affect user-visible or system-visible behavior.
- Documentation changes must be identified when repository documentation is created, updated, relocated, or removed.
- Artifact changes must be identified when requirements, specifications, diagrams, data models, or architecture artifacts are affected.
- Implementation details should be omitted unless they are necessary for reviewer understanding.
- Change summaries must avoid describing work that is not included in the pull request.

</change_summary>

<test_validation>

- Test validation must distinguish verified results from assumptions.
- Test reporting must identify what was tested.
- Validation reporting must identify what was verified.

</test_validation>

<artifact_validation>

- Artifact consistency must be validated when submitted changes affect repository artifacts.
- Documentation consistency must be validated when submitted changes affect documented behavior, requirements, or repository expectations.
- Specification consistency must be validated when submitted changes affect API contracts, data models, flows, sequence interactions, or architecture decisions.
- Architecture consistency must be validated when submitted changes affect structural boundaries, integrations, or long-term design decisions.
- Affected requirements, API specifications, ERDs, flow diagrams, sequence diagrams, and architecture artifacts must remain traceable.
- Artifact changes must be consistent with related repository documentation and submitted code or configuration changes.
- Artifact validation gaps must be identified before pull request submission.

</artifact_validation>

<assignee_assignment>

- Pull requests may define assignees.
- Assignees must be verified repository collaborators when repository information is available.
- Assignee selection should remain consistent with issue ownership when applicable.
- Pull request creation should assign the pull request creator by default when the creator can be verified as a repository collaborator.
- Related issue assignees may be used instead of the default creator only when issue ownership is verified and more appropriate for the submitted work.
- An explicitly requested assignee overrides the default creator assignment only when the assignee is verified.
- Assignee values must not be invented.
- Missing assignee information should be reported rather than assumed.
- Assignee assignment decisions must remain traceable to verified repository information.
- Assignee assignment must not imply reviewer assignment, project assignment, milestone assignment, or merge automation.

</assignee_assignment>

<label_propagation>

- Pull request labels should align with related issue labels when applicable.
- Labels should be verified before assignment.
- Applicable labels may be derived from verified issue metadata.
- Pull request creation must attach all applicable verified labels that match the related work content.
- When a related issue exists, applicable labels should be propagated from the verified issue labels unless the submitted pull request scope clearly requires a different verified label set.
- Label assignment should remain consistent with repository label strategy.
- Missing labels must not be invented.
- Label inconsistencies between issues and pull requests should be identified when detected.
- Label assignment decisions must remain traceable to verified repository information.
- Label propagation must not create or modify repository label governance unless repository governance work is explicitly requested.

</label_propagation>

<review_readiness>

- Pull requests are review-ready only when traceability has been validated.
- Pull requests are review-ready only when the change summary accurately reflects submitted work.
- Pull requests are review-ready only when validation evidence is identified.
- Pull requests are review-ready only when affected artifacts and documentation are consistent or gaps are identified.
- Repository consistency must be checked when changes affect structure, configuration, templates, labels, branches, documentation, or artifacts.
- Pull requests that are not review-ready must be identified before submission.
- Review readiness must be based on verified branch, diff, commit, issue, and validation information.

</review_readiness>

<template_usage>

- Pull request descriptions should use `templates/pr.md` when the template exists.
- The pull request template is the canonical pull request deliverable format.
- Template sections should be populated from verified requirements, verified specifications, issues, commits, artifacts, validation evidence, submitted changes, and pull request preparation results.
