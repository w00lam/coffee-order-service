<review_modes>

- Review execution represents reviewing submitted work.
- Review response represents responding to review feedback.
- Review verification represents validating whether previously reported concerns have been addressed.
- Review mode must be identified before review conclusions are generated.
- Review execution must evaluate the submitted work against verified requirements, diffs, artifacts, and validation evidence.
- Review response must evaluate the feedback, the author's reasoning, and any implemented changes.
- Review verification must evaluate current pull request state rather than relying on previous conclusions.

</review_modes>

<review_lifecycle>

- Review lifecycle activities include Review Execution, Review Response, Review Verification, and Review Decision.
- Review Execution establishes findings and conclusions for submitted work.
- Review Response evaluates how review feedback is handled by the author or reviewer.
- Review Verification evaluates whether previously reported concerns have been addressed.
- Review Decision determines the current review outcome from verified review state.
- Review conclusions may change when new commits are added.
- Review conclusions may change when new evidence is introduced.
- Review conclusions may change when new review comments are created.
- Review conclusions may change when existing concerns are re-evaluated.
- Review conclusions must be based on the current pull request state.
- Previous review conclusions must not prevent re-evaluation.

</review_lifecycle>

<review_scope>

- Supported review scopes include pull request scope, review summary scope, file scope, diff scope, code block scope, line range scope, review comment scope, and conversation scope.
- Review feedback should be attached to the smallest verified scope that accurately represents the concern.
- Line-level feedback should be preferred when the concern is localized.
- File-level or diff-level feedback should be used when the concern spans related changes in a single file or diff.
- Pull request-level feedback should be used when the concern affects the submitted work as a whole.
- Review comment scope should be used when evaluating or responding to existing feedback.
- Conversation scope represents an existing review discussion thread.
- Conversation scope should be used when reviewing discussion context, responding to discussion feedback, verifying discussion resolution, or determining whether a conversation can be resolved.
- Scope selection must be based on verified evidence and reviewer actionability.

</review_scope>

<review_execution>

- Requirement validation must verify whether submitted work satisfies the requested behavior, constraints, and acceptance expectations when available.
- Artifact validation must verify consistency with affected requirements, specifications, diagrams, data models, flows, sequence interactions, and architecture artifacts when relevant.
- Code validation must evaluate correctness, reliability, security, maintainability, readability, and consistency with submitted scope.
- Test validation must verify whether available tests or checks support the submitted changes.
- Review execution must not run local tests; local test execution belongs to Test Skill.
- Review execution may evaluate CI results, remote checks, submitted test logs, and other verified validation evidence.
- Risk identification must identify uncertainty that may affect correctness, reliability, security, maintainability, delivery, or coordination.
- Defect identification must be based on verified behavior, code, diff, artifact, or validation evidence.
- Review findings must distinguish defects, risks, suggestions, and questions.
- Review conclusions must remain objective and actionable.

</review_execution>

<review_severity>

- Review findings must be classified as Blocking or Non-Blocking when severity affects review decisions.
- Blocking findings represent concerns that should be resolved before merge.
- Blocking findings may result in Request Changes decisions.
- Blocking findings must be supported by verified evidence.
- Non-Blocking findings represent suggestions, observations, questions, or improvements.
- Non-Blocking findings do not prevent merge.
- Non-Blocking findings may be communicated through review comments or review summaries.
- Severity classification must remain independent from review scope.
- Severity classification must remain independent from review response handling.
- Severity classification must be based on verified evidence and repository expectations.

</review_severity>

<review_context>

- Review conclusions should apply only to the active reviewer unless repository governance defines collective review rules.
- Approval by one reviewer must not imply approval by other reviewers.
- Request Changes by one reviewer must not imply Request Changes by other reviewers.
- Review decisions should be evaluated from the perspective of the active reviewer.
- Review conclusions should remain traceable to the reviewer that produced them.
- Review context must support repositories with multiple reviewers.
- Collective review behavior must be based on verified repository governance when it is applied.

</review_context>

<review_boundaries>

- Review decisions represent reviewer conclusions.
- Review decisions do not imply merge authorization.
- Approval does not automatically imply merge approval.
- Merge decisions remain outside the scope of review activities unless repository governance explicitly defines otherwise.
- Review outcomes and merge outcomes must remain separate concepts.
- Review conclusions should remain traceable to the reviewer that produced them.
- Review activities must not assume repository-level merge authority.
- Repository-level merge authority must be determined from verified repository governance and platform rules.

</review_boundaries>

<review_comment_generation>

- Review comments must be based on verified evidence.
- Review comments must clearly identify the concern.
- Review comments must explain the impact of the concern.
- Review comments must explain the reason for the concern.
- Review comments must distinguish blocking and non-blocking feedback.
- Comment scope must match the smallest accurate review scope.
- When the user asks to post, submit, leave, or create review feedback on a pull request, localized findings must be posted as inline review comments when they can be tied to a specific changed line.
- Pull request-level review comments must be used only when the concern cannot be accurately attached to a changed file, diff hunk, or line.
- Localized findings must not be downgraded to pull request-level summaries only because the user did not explicitly request inline comments.
- Before posting review comments, each finding must be mapped to Inline Comment, File/Diff Comment, Pull Request Summary, or Not Posted.
- If the platform does not allow an inline comment on the selected line, use the nearest accurate changed line when that preserves the concern; otherwise use a pull request-level comment and state why inline placement was unavailable.
- Review summaries may accompany inline comments, but summaries must not replace inline comments for localized findings.
- Comments should be actionable enough for the author to respond or make a change.
- Subjective preferences should be avoided unless they are clearly identified as preferences.
- Review comments should not use emojis or decorative symbols.
- Review comments should use the repository team's primary communication language according to `skills/common.md`.

<review_summary_generation>

- Review summaries must consolidate review findings.
- Review summaries must separate blocking concerns from non-blocking concerns.
- Review summaries must summarize overall review status.

- Review responses may reject feedback with justification.
- Review responses may request clarification.
- Review responses may propose alternative solutions.
- Review responses must classify feedback handling as Accepted, Rejected, Clarification Requested, or Alternative Proposed when a response outcome is needed.
- Accepted feedback handling means the feedback is agreed with and addressed or planned for action.
- Rejected feedback handling means the feedback is not accepted and the response provides justification.
- Clarification Requested feedback handling means the feedback cannot be acted on without additional information.
- Alternative Proposed feedback handling means a different solution is proposed to address the underlying concern.
- Feedback handling classification must remain separate from review outcome decisions.
- Review responses must not claim resolution without verified supporting changes or reasoning.
