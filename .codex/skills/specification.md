## Output

Use `templates/specification.md`.

Populate all applicable sections.

Do not omit mandatory sections defined by the template.

Document only verified behavior and requirements.

Do not invent undocumented API behavior, fields, validation, errors, or business rules.

Place unresolved specification decisions under Open Questions.

Place unverified but necessary working assumptions under Assumptions.

The template is the canonical output format for specification deliverables.

## Success Criteria

- Specification artifacts cover the requested interfaces, models, flows, or rules.
- API specifications include request, response, validation, and error cases when applicable.
- Data models define entities, relationships, constraints, and ownership boundaries when applicable.
- Flow, sequence, and state specifications identify decision points and exception paths when applicable.
- Business and validation rules are explicit and traceable.
- Assumptions and unresolved specification gaps are documented.
- Specifications are consistent with verified requirements, domains, and related artifacts.

<trusted_sources>

- Verified requirements are authoritative for requested outcomes, constraints, scope, acceptance expectations, and business rules.
- Accepted decisions are authoritative for selected direction, rejected alternatives, constraints, and downstream impact when they affect specifications.
- Verified domain structures are authoritative for domain boundaries, ownership boundaries, dependencies, grouping, and domain responsibility.
- Existing repository artifacts are authoritative when they describe current APIs, data models, flows, sequences, states, business rules, validation rules, or constraints.
- Existing specifications are authoritative when they are current and consistent with verified requirements, verified domains, and repository state.
- Existing documentation is authoritative when it is current and consistent with verified requirements, verified domains, existing specifications, and repository state.
- Repository governance resources are authoritative for specification artifact locations, documentation expectations, ownership boundaries, and downstream workflow expectations.
- Specification decisions must prioritize verified information over assumptions.
- Conflicting information must be reconciled before specifications are finalized.
- Unverified information must be recorded as an assumption or unresolved question rather than treated as a specification decision.

<cli_policy>

- CLI verification may be used when repository artifacts, existing specifications, documentation, or governance resources affect specification generation or validation.
- CLI usage should support verification rather than replace requirements validation, domain analysis, or specification judgment.
- Repository artifacts should be inspected when they affect APIs, data models, flows, sequences, states, business rules, validation rules, constraints, or artifact locations.
- Existing specifications and documentation should be inspected when they affect consistency, traceability, or current repository behavior.
- Git history should be inspected only when artifact provenance or historical specification decisions affect specification generation or validation.
- CLI verification must be scoped to specification generation and specification validation.
